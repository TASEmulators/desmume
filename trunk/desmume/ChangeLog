0.9.5 -> 0.9.6 (r3075-r3493)

Users of gtk, cli and gtk-glade frontends please note that now we
have a common directory in ~/.config/desmume for config file,
saves and savestates. The old .desmume.ini will be moved
automatically with the name config but you have to move your saves
manually.

Some save files may be invalidated due to use of broken crc logic.
Back up your DSV files before using this version of the emulator or else
the game might wipe it.

0.8 -> 0.9
 There have been so many changes that this list can hardly be considered complete.
 For this release, we have formatted the list into a high level overview of big changes and bad bugs relative to the previous release. Hopefully what you're interested in.
 This list does not include items which are solely performance boosts, for let us just say that virtually every system has been speeded up.
  
 * The savestate system is totally changed and incompatible with old savestates.
 * The 3d system should be considered rewritten.
 
General/Core:
 enh: Convert to c++
 enh: Add functions for a lid open/close. Holding key (default "Backspace" in Windows port) while game is freeze/non freeze. [CrazyMax]
 enh: Add secure area decryption from ndstool [zeromus]
 enh: Change savestate code to support loosely bound chunks and more easily other parts of the emu (GE, GPU).
      The savestate format is changed, but from now on it is in principle more resilient 
      (though it will continue to break as we tinker with the internals) [zeromus]
 enh: Added SSE2 optimizations for matrices. Since we now make an SSE2 build, more optimizations can be made. [CrazyMax]
 enh: Add a preliminary GUI hud system [CrazyMax,zeromus]

CPU/MMU:
 bug: Many fixes in IPC and GE FIFOs. Fixes freezes in NSMB, dsracing, and others. [CrazyMax,luigi__,shash]

Hardware: 
 bug: Newer and better sqrt and div emulation; makes SM64DS playable [luigi__,shash,zeromus]

Graphics:
 - Overhaul 3d:
  . Move entire GE to core emu.
  . Move OpenGL renderer to emu core for optional use by platforms, removing ogl_collector. Now every platform shares the same 3d code.
  . Reorganize 3d code to defer rendering to after 3d vblank. Eliminates tearing, and texturing artifacts. [zeromus]
  . Add optional fragment shading pipeline (more precision) [luigi__]
  . Move lighting model to software instead of using opengl's fixed function model [zeromus]
  . Render shadow volumes; toon shading and highlight table [zeromus, luigi__]
  . Added texture caching! big speed up. [CrazyMax]

 bug: Add 3d layer h-scrolling [zeromus]
 bug: Added transparency and fixed material alpha support and alpha testing on the 3D core [shash]
 bug: Rewrite VRAM mapping control and rendering (more accurate) [CrazyMax,luigi__]

 bug: convert colors to opengl better to prevent alpha=31 polys from being ever so slightly transparent [zeromus]
 enh: Add MMU->GPU signal for when vram mappings change to function as a texture cache invalidate signal [zeromus]
 enh: Make matrix 4x4 multiply routines use W-coordinate; carry w coord through pipeline [zeromus]
