0.8 -> 0.9
 There have been so many changes that this list can hardly be considered complete.
 The savestate system is totally changed and incompatible with old savestates.
 General/Core:
 - Convert to c++!
 - Added "high-level" check for DMAs and Timer for minor (really minor) speed up [shash]
 - Changed instruction execution to 16 at a time blocks (tested and stable) [shash]
 - Really minor memory access speed up (mainly added for clarity) [shash]
 - Fixes in IPC FIFO [CrazyMax]
 - Add Geometry FIFO simulation (New SMB and others games not freeze now) [CrazyMax]
 - Add cosine interpolation in the SPU (conditionally compiled) [zeromus,luigi__]
 - Experiment: always one silent SPU core at 44.1khz synched with emu for more precision.
   The audible core runs with the host, causing music to slow down but not tear or pitch bend. [zeromus]
 - Change savestate code to support loosely bound chunks and more easily other parts of the emu (GE, GPU).
   The savestate format is changed, but from now on it is in principle more resilient 
   (though it will continue to break as we tinker with the internals) [zeromus]
 - Remove 16MB of WRAM at 0x01****** from arm9. Mapped to unused instead. What was this? [zeromus]
 - Add RTC implementations (not fully) [CrazyMax]
 - Add a GUI hud system; start adding some HUD elements
 - Add functions for a lid open/close. Holding key (default "Backspace" in Windows port) while game is freeze/non freeze. [CrazyMax]
 - Added a bunch of crazy templates to the cpu and mmu for minor speed boosts [zeromus]
 - Add secure area decryption from ndstool [zeromus]
 - change backupmem autodetection to catch more cases of unusual usage patterns [zeromus]
 - Fixed Thumb LDMIA (fixes ingame Dead'n'Furious) [shash]
 Graphics:
 - Added gfx3d module which emulates the whole GE as part of the core emu. [zeromus]
 - Moved the windows/cocoa OGLRender to the emu core and replace ogl_collector. 
   Now every platform shares the same 3d code. [zeromus]
 - Reorganize 3d code to defer rendering to after 3d vblank. eliminates tearing, and texturing artifacts. [zeromus]
 - Add optional fragment shading pipeline for more precision [luigi__]
 - Many tweaks and improvements to 3d precision [zeromus, CrazyMax, luigi__]
 - Rewrite VRAM mapping control and rendering [CrazyMax, luigi__]
 - Improvements to 2d/3d compositing aiming at better NSMB rendering; still imperfect [zeromus] 
 - Fix in capture display (many games with both 3D screen not blinking now) [CrazyMax]
 - Fix in master brightness (this is fix games with black screens) [CrazyMax] 
 - Added SSE2 version for some matrix routines [CrazyMax]
 - Make matrix 4x4 multiply routines use W-coordinate. [zeromus]
 - Add many matrix and vector functions to matrix.cpp [zeromus]
 - Added transparency and fixed material alpha support and alpha testing on the 3D core [shash]
 - Changed how depth initial values are calculated (fixes SM64DS skybox) [shash] 
 - Some fixes in 3D core OGL (fixed textures) [CrazyMax]
 - Added texture caching (speedup 3D core) [CrazyMax]
 - Render shadow volumes [zeromus, luigi__]
 - Toon shading system [luigi__]
 - carry w=1 from vertex() through pipeline (this will be necessary for software 3d rendering) [zeromus]
 - Fix clear depth (ex. Castlevania now doesnt flip) [lugi__]
 - Make GE matrix mult and load commands clear out unused rows and cols to identity correctly [zeromus]
 - Setup to track polycount better, but still worthless, not accounting for clipping and culling [zeromus]
 - Fix errors in matrix operations regarding projection mode and pos-vector mode [zeromus]
 - Fix error in command unpacking which caused some display lists to totally blow up [zeromus]
 - Convert alpha and material values from [0,31], [0,7] etc ranges to opengl [0,maxint] ranges in a more precise way [zeromus]
 - Add opengl state caching. This is of dubious performance assistance, but it is easy to take out so I am leaving it for now. [zeromus]
 - Add MMU->GPU signal for when vram mappings change, which allows it to assume textures are unchanged unless vram has changed [zeromus]
 - Move lighting model to software instead of using opengl for more precision [zeromus]
 - Fix a bug in texture transformation mode 1 [zeromus]
 Mac OS X port:
 - Fixed: Filenames and paths with unicode characters now work. [Jeff]
