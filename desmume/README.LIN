                        DeSmuME

DeSmuME is written in C++ using the GTK+ and SDL libraries.

* https://www.gtk.org
* https://www.libsdl.org/

DeSmuME provides another interface based on libglade, to use
, you'll need glade:

* https://glade.gnome.org/

To build, cd to src/frontend/posix and then run ./configure && make

It will generate three programs:
1) "desmume" in the "gtk" directory;
2) "desmume-cli" in the "cli" directory.

If glade is installed on your system, you'll get a third
binary:

3) "desmume-glade" in the "gtk-glade" directory.

You can even type "make install" to install those programs on
your system (in /usr/local/ by default); then uninstalling is
done by typing "make uninstall".

For more information on the available commandline options, 
check the other README files which will be more up to date.

The following options specially are available on these posix ports:

--disable-limiter   Disables the 60 fps limiter
--soft-convert      Use software colour conversion during OpenGL
                    screen rendering. May produce better or worse
                    frame rates depending on hardware.

The following options specially are available on the Gtk+ port:

--opengl-2d         Enables using OpenGL for screen rendering
--disable-sound     Disables the sound emulation
--disable-3d        Disables the 3D emulation

The following options specially are available on the CLI port:

--opengl-2d         Enables using OpenGL for screen rendering
--disable-sound     Disables the sound emulation

NOTE:
The Gtk+ and Glade builds use gtkGLext to handle the OpenGL
rendering and contexts. You may get improved performance by
also passing the argument --gdk-gl-force-indirect. This has
been seen to improve things for Nvidia based graphics cards
under Linux.
