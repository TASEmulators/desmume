//#define MAPPED_JIT_FUNCS: to define or not to define?
//* x86 windows seems faster with NON-DEFINED
//* x64 windows seems faster with DEFINED
//* x86 windows seems to have problems without DEFINED when desmume is built as a dll due to the 
//   ~300 MB .bss section created by the 256MB non-mapped compiled_funcs table
//   (when loaded as a dll into a busy process, that much contiguous address space is hard to find. No big deal when starting up a process)
//In principle, mapped compiled_funcs should be faster because it avoids some bit shifting logic to look it up from the memory map, right, 
//but I guess it doesn't always work out that way.
//
//So here's my proposed policy. NON-DEFINED is dangerous due to the huge .bss section, so it should be the default
//The build system should #define JIT_FUNCS_FLAT to make the flat array
