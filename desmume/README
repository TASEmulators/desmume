1) About ______________________________________________________________________

DeSmuME is software that allows you to emulate a Nintendo DS system. Think of
it as a Swiss-Army knife for Nintendo DS emulation, giving you access to many
powerful tools for testing DS features, from viewing ROM properties to managing
Action Replay cheats. And best of all, this software is completely free and
open-source.

For information on how to install or operate DeSmuME for your operating system,
please see the README file that should be present with your installation.

Port-specific README files:
    * README.LIN for the Linux port
    * README.WIN for the Windows port
    * README.MAC for the Macintosh port

Note that each DeSmuME port may have a different feature set from another port.
You may see more feature parity between ports over time as we continue
developing DeSmuME.
