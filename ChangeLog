0.9.2 -> 0.9.4 (r1844->r2352->r2437)

0.8 -> 0.9
 There have been so many changes that this list can hardly be considered complete.
 For this release, we have formatted the list into a high level overview of big changes and bad bugs relative to the previous release. Hopefully what you're interested in.
 This list does not include items which are solely performance boosts, for let us just say that virtually every system has been speeded up.
  
 * The savestate system is totally changed and incompatible with old savestates.
 * The 3d system should be considered rewritten.
 
General/Core:
 enh: Convert to c++
 enh: Add functions for a lid open/close. Holding key (default "Backspace" in Windows port) while game is freeze/non freeze. [CrazyMax]
 enh: Add secure area decryption from ndstool [zeromus]
 enh: Change savestate code to support loosely bound chunks and more easily other parts of the emu (GE, GPU).
      The savestate format is changed, but from now on it is in principle more resilient 
      (though it will continue to break as we tinker with the internals) [zeromus]
 enh: Added SSE2 optimizations for matrices. Since we now make an SSE2 build, more optimizations can be made. [CrazyMax]
 enh: Add a preliminary GUI hud system [CrazyMax,zeromus]

CPU/MMU:
 bug: Many fixes in IPC and GE FIFOs. Fixes freezes in NSMB, dsracing, and others. [CrazyMax,luigi__,shash]
 bug: Fix ARM instructions SBC and RSC (likewise SBC in thumb) [normatt]
 bug: Fixed Thumb LDMIA (fixes ingame Dead'n'Furious) [shash]
 bug: Fix repeating DMA (fixes NSMB parallax BG) [zeromus]
 bug: Proper handling for unaligned CPU accesses [luigi__]
 bug: Proper handling for undefined instruction exceptions [Salva Peiró]
 bug: correctly return vram control register values (fixes homebrew 3d games) [zeromus]
 enh: Remove 16MB of WRAM at 0x01****** from arm9. Mapped to unused instead. Nobody knows what this was. [zeromus]
 enh: Changed instruction execution to 16 at a time blocks (tested and stable) [shash]

Hardware: 
 bug: Newer and better sqrt and div emulation; makes SM64DS playable [luigi__,shash,zeromus]
 bug: Add preliminary RTC implementations [CrazyMax]
 enh: Add cosine interpolation in the SPU (conditionally compiled) [zeromus,luigi__]
 enh: Experimental: always one silent non-mixing SPU core at 44.1khz synched with emu, for more precision.
      The audible core runs with the host, causing music to slow down but not tear or pitch bend. [zeromus]

Graphics:
 - Overhaul 3d:
  . Move entire GE to core emu.
  . Move OpenGL renderer to emu core for optional use by platforms, removing ogl_collector. Now every platform shares the same 3d code.
  . Reorganize 3d code to defer rendering to after 3d vblank. Eliminates tearing, and texturing artifacts. [zeromus]
  . Add optional fragment shading pipeline (more precision) [luigi__]
  . Move lighting model to software instead of using opengl's fixed function model [zeromus]
  . Render shadow volumes; toon shading and highlight table [zeromus, luigi__]
  . Added texture caching! big speed up. [CrazyMax]

 bug: Fixes to GE: command unpacking, projection and pos-vector mode matrix handling, mult and load commands [zeromus]
 bug: Fix a bug in texture transformation mode 1 [zeromus]
 bug: Fixed GPU rendering bugs in sprites and BG [CrazyMax]
 bug: Fixes to texture conversion [CrazyMax,zeromus]
 bug: Fixes in capture display (no blinking in many games with dual 3D) [CrazyMax]
 bug: Fixes in master brightness (this fixes some games with black screens) [CrazyMax] 
 bug: Fixes in screen, backdrop, and sprite blending [luigi__]
 bug: Changed clear depths and how depth initial values are calculated (fixes SM64DS skybox, Castlevania) [shash,lugi__] 
 bug: Add 3d layer h-scrolling [zeromus]
 bug: Added transparency and fixed material alpha support and alpha testing on the 3D core [shash]
 bug: Rewrite VRAM mapping control and rendering (more accurate) [CrazyMax,luigi__]

 bug: convert colors to opengl better to prevent alpha=31 polys from being ever so slightly transparent [zeromus]
 enh: Add MMU->GPU signal for when vram mappings change to function as a texture cache invalidate signal [zeromus]
 enh: Make matrix 4x4 multiply routines use W-coordinate; carry w coord through pipeline [zeromus]

 enh: Add AVI output [zeromus]
 enh: Add pause toggle and frame advance hotkeys [adelikat]
 enh: Add frame counter display and hud messages framework [adelikat]
