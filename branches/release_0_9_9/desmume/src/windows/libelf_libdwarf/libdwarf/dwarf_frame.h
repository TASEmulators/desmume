/* The dwarf 2.0 standard dictates that only the following
 * fields can be read when an unexpected augmentation string
 * (in the cie) is encountered: CIE length, CIE_id, version and
 * augmentation; FDE: length, CIE pointer, initial location and
 * address range. Unfortunately, with the above restrictions, it
 * is impossible to read the instruction table from a CIE or a FDE
 * when a new augmentation string is encountered.
 * To fix this problem, the following layout is used, if the
 * augmentation string starts with the string "z".
 *   CIE                        FDE
 *   length                     length
 *   CIE_id                     CIE_pointer
 *   version                    initial_location
 *   augmentation               address_range
 *                              length_of_augmented_fields (*NEW*)
 *   code_alignment_factor      Any new fields as necessary
 *   data_alignment_factor      instruction_table
 *   return_address
 *   length_of_augmented fields
 *   Any new fields as necessary
 *   initial_instructions
 *
 * The type of all the old data items are the same as what is
 * described in dwarf 2.0 standard. The length_of_augmented_fields
 * is an LEB128 data item that denotes the size (in bytes) of
 * the augmented fields (not including the size of
 * "length_of_augmented_fields" itself).
 
 * Handling of cie augmentation strings is necessarly a heuristic.
 * See dwarf_frame.c for the currently known augmentation strings.


   ---START SGI-ONLY COMMENT:
 * SGI-IRIX versions of cie or fde  were intended to use "z1", "z2" as the
 * augmenter strings if required for new augmentation.
 * However, that never happened (as of March 2005).
 *
 * The fde's augmented by the string "z" have a new field 
 * (signed constant, 4 byte field)
 * called offset_into_exception_tables, following the 
 * length_of_augmented field.   This field contains an offset 
 * into the "_MIPS_eh_region", which describes
 * the IRIX CC exception handling tables.
   ---END SGI-ONLY COMMENT
 

 * GNU .eh_frame has an augmentation string of z[RLP]* (gcc 3.4)
 * The similarity to IRIX 'z' (and proposed but never
 * implemented IRIX z1, z2 etc) was confusing things.
 * If the section is .eh_frame then 'z' means GNU exception
 * information 'Augmentation Data' not IRIX 'z'.
 * See The Linux Standard Base Core Specification version 3.0
