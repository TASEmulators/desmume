Quick Getting Started Guide 
When you start the emulator for the first time, you probably just want to play a certain game. You can do this by going to 'File' in the menu, and selecting 'Open Rom'. This will open up an explorer window, within which you can browse to the rom (nds file) that you wish to play. Once the game has finished loading (and this should only take a few seconds at most), your game will automatically start running. But if you want, you can also compile from source. See the article Installing DeSmuME from source on Windows for details. 

Menu Layout 
The rest of this manual will be spend on explaining all the other options in the menu. 




File Menu 
File | Open Rom 
This option is for loading games. A game is typically called a rom file. Just use the explorer window to browse to the file, and click on open. The game should just load and start. The desmume windows port is also able to load some compressed formats, like zip, rar, and 7-zip. Just as long as there is a valid game (rom) file in the compressed archive ending with an .nds extension, it should load fine. 

File | Recent Rom 
This menu option contains a list of the roms that you have most recently loaded. You can quickly access a game that way, without having browse to the right directory with the 'Open Rom' option. 

File | Rom Info 
This option offers some information about the internals of the rom file, like name, code, manufacturer, and size. This should not concern the casual gamer, but may come in handy for developers. 

File | Save State As... 
Imagine you have gotten to a certian point in a game, and you need to do something else. The emulator let's you save the current state of the game, so that you can continue the game later at precisely the same point somewhere in the future. 

File | Load State As... 
Once you have saved a game's position, or 'state', you can load it again with this option. 

File | Save State 
This option works fairly similair to the 'Save As' option, altough it let's you save numbers instead os specifying a chosen name. Also, All the states saved via this option end up with a pre-determined name of 'game (rom) name'.dsx. So if the game is called MyGame, the first savefile will be called MyGame.ds0, the second one MyGame.ds1, etc. 

File | Load State 
This option let's you load the states that you saved via the 'File | Save State' option 

File | Import Backup Memory 
Backup Memory is the data the game uses to remember its own state. It is stored on the cart in a normal game. The file format is '.duc'. .duc is the same thing as .sav but a different format. People use pro action replays to capture it from their card and post it online without using emulators. Go to gamefaqs.com and find a '.duc' save file for a game you can use that function to import it into desmume. Its the save file. save ram. where your saved game goes. desmume calls it .sav file 

File | Save Screenshot As... 
This lets you take a screenshot of the current view of the emulator, and specify it's name to save as a bitmap (.bmp) file. 

File | Quick Screenshot 
This option also dumps a screencapture, but it has a pre-determied filename and location. It will be called printscreen.bmp, and located in the current directory. In Windows, this is probably the same folder as where your desmume binary is located. 

File | Record AVI 
This option lets you capture what's going on in the emulator, and save it in an avi file. 

File | Stop AVI 
The 'Record AVI' option continues to record the game, untill you press the 'Stop Avi' option. 

File | Quit 
Choosing this option exits the emulator. 




Emulation Menu 
Emulation | Pause 
This option will pause the emulation, freezing it at the current moment of execution. Selecting it again will resume the execution of the ROM at the exact moment where you paused it. 

Emulation | Reset 
This option will reset the ROM that is currently loaded to the very start of the ROM, just as if you chose 'File | Open Rom' again. 

Emulation | Shut Up 
This option turns off all the sound. 

Emulation | GBA Slot 
This menu option pop-ups a new window, which lets you specirfy what to do with the GBA slot of the Nintendo DS. It has the following choices : NONE, Compact Flash, Rumble Pack, GBA Game. Rumble pack allows some games to use vibration. Memory extension... Extends memory. And some DS games can have bonuses, unlockable by GBA cart. For example in Megaman ZX you can fight some Megaman Zero Bosses when correct cartridge is inserted. There are also other GBA slot extensions, like... a Guitar hero controller. But these are currently not emulated by desmume. Flash Cartridge is used for homebrew software emulation, for example that uses DLDI ( Dynamically Linked Device Interface). 

Emulation | Cheats 
This option pulls down a drop-down menu, and presents the options list and search. Be aware though, that cheats are sort of half baked right now. If you are not having luck, wait for some news on an improved cheat system. 

Emulation | Cheats | List 
Choosing 'list' will list all the currently known cheats. Please refer to the article Using Cheats in DeSmuMe for further details on how to use the cheat mechanism in desmume. 

Emulation | Cheats | Search 
Choosing 'search' will let you search for cheats. Please refer to the article Using Cheats in DeSmuMe for further details on how to use the cheat mechanism in desmume. 

View Menu 
View | Rotation 
This option will let you rotate the screen a pre-determined amount of degrees in order to adjust the angle of the display. Some programs require that you normally turn the DS on its side. You can set it up in that manner using this. The options are 0 (no rotation),90 ,180, and 270. 

View | Window size 
This option will let you enlarge the windows a pre-determined size. The resize options are: 1x, 1.5x, 2x, 3x, and 4x the default size. You can also adjust the window size by clicking on the edge of the window, and dragging the mouse. 

View | Screen Separation 
This option controls how far the two windows should be apart of each other, in other words: how big the border between them should be. Valid choices are: None (which is the default), narrow border (which is slightly larger), DS (which is about the wsame amount of room there is on a real Nintendo DS). 

View | Force Maintain Ratio 
Here you can choose, when re-sizing the windows, if you wan to maintain the ratio of the windows. Sometimes when the window size is changed it doesn't look correct on the screen. This option forces the window to maintain a correct ratio so it looks correct. You can select or de-select this option. 

View | Display Frame Counter 
Selecting this option causes a counter to run, that counts all the frames that have been displayed. 

View | Display FPS 
Selecting this option causes the 'frames-per-second' (or 'fps', for short) to be displayed. 

View | Display Input 
Selecting this option displays the keys you press on the keyboard, which is the input 

View | Display Lag Counter 
This option causes a counter to display that counts frames where the game doesn't poll input. 

View | HUD Editing Mode 
This option will let you drag around hud elements to pick their position. 




Config Menu 
Config | Save Type 
This option lets you specify the save type of a particular game. The default is 'automatic'. However, this is not fail-safe in all cases, so you might need to manually select one of the other savetypes. 

Config | 3D Settings 
This option lets you select the method that is used to draw the screen. You can choose between OpenGL (an open standard) or SoftRasterizer (a desmume specific method). 

Config | Control Config 
This option lets you configure keyboard keys or a joystick. The joystick support is implemented using a DirectInput control interface. 

Config | Hotkey Config 
This menu option lets you define keys, that can be used to quickly select other options without having to go through the entire menu structure. Some examples are A hotkey for 'pause', or a hotkey for loading a specific savestate. 

Config | Sound Settings 
This option lets you choose between different sound generating methods, which currectly are 'Direct Sound Interface' and 'WAV Write sound Interface'. it also let's you specify the size of the buffer to buffer the sound. 

Config | WIFI Settings 
WIFI support is currently under heavy development, but it is not deemed ready for inclusion in the general public releases yet. Therefore, you may find this option missing, or simply 'greyed-out' for now. 

Config | Firmware Settings 
This option provides you with the same set of options that a real Nintendo DS firmware does. The most important here is the language, for multi-langual games will often look at how this option is set. 

Config | Emulation Settings 
These options let you boot from the extracted BIOS and Firmware of a real Nintendo DS. unless you have extracted/downloaded the firmware or bios from a Nintendo DS that you actually own yourself, these settings have no value for you qas desmume does not require them to run correctly. 

Config | Frame Skip 
This option lets you select how many frames should not be displayed, in order to gain speed improvements. The default is 'Auto'. If you have speed problems, you could decide to skip (not display) one or more frames in order to improve the speed. 'Limit Frameskip' let's you limit the frame rate to 60fps maximum. 60fps is essentially the speed that the game plays at on the actual console itself. So by selecting this option, you're limiting the framerate to the actual speed of the actual console. 

Config | Language 
This lets you set the langguage the emulator displays it's menu's and options in. 

Tools Menu 
Tools | Disassembler 
This option displays the ARM9 and ARM7 disassembler. Be aware though, that the windows are drawn exactly on top of each other, so that you have to move (drag n drop) the first windows before the second window shows. 

Tools | View Memory 
This tool displays the ARM7 and ARM9 memory. Be aware though, that the windows are drawn exactly on top of each other, so that you have to move (drag n drop) the first windows before the second window shows. 

The "View mode" radio buttons allow you to choose how the memory will be shown: 

8-bit : shows the memory as bytes 
16-bit : shows the memory as words 
32-bit : shows the memory as dwords 
The "View address" textbox and button allow you to jump to a different address: 

Enter an hexadecimal address without 0x prefix, with up to 8 digits 
Click "Go" to jump to the entered address 
The "View dump" buttons allow you to dump the current view: 

Text dump : dumps the view to a text file, in an human-readable form 
Raw dump : dumps the memory directly to a binary file which can be read with an hex editor 
Note that if you dump memory to a file already containing (a) dump(s), the new dump will be appended to the existing one(s). 

The scrollbar... well, you surely know how a scrollbar works. 

The viewers additionally allow to edit the memory. For it, click on the value you want to edit, then type the new value. The new value is applied only once you've entirely entered it. 

Tools | View Registers 
This option lets you view the ARM7 and ARM9 I/O registers. 

Tools | View Palette 
This option lets you view the palette in detail. 

Tools | View Tiles 
This option lets you view the tiles in detail.

General Questions 
What does desmume emulate and on what systems? 
Desmume attempts to emulate, as faithfully as possible, the Nintendo DS and Nintendo DS Lite handheld game consoles (nds). It currently runs on Windows, Linux, and mac OSX. DSi is not supported. 

What does DeSmuME mean? 
DeSmuME is a Nintendo DS emulator and the name is a play of words - DS Emu + ME (like FlashMe - firmware hack and PassMe mod-chip for DS) The name DeSmuME derives from the popular use of ME in Nintendo DS products by homebrew developers. So DeSmuME would equal DSemuMe. Other popular uses of ME include: 

LoadMe - a generic patcher for commercial DS roms that works with any GBA Flash Card 
PassMe - "mod-chip" using which takes authentication from an original DS card an allows execution of unauthenticated DS rom code - from the GBA cartridge slot / GBA flash card. 
FlashMe - a hacked firmware for DS that allows you to start code in DS mode from a flash card in the GBA slot. 
WifiMe - are a set of a custom drivers and software by FireFly for RALink based wireless network cards enabling to boot homebrew code on DS via Nintendo Wireless Multiboot method. 
Why doesn't my desmume play this game? 
Go to desmume.org and make sure you are using the latest version. Hint: desmume 0.8 and 0.3.4 are very old. Older versions will not be supported, under any circumstances. 
Why does this game fail to save? 
Desmume's autodetection for save types is not very good. For now, you need to manually specify the correct save type for your game. Consult the manual for details on how to do this for your platform. We want to fix this, but there are no specific plans so far. You may also consult http://www.advanscene.com/ to easily identify the save type for your game. 
Can I use my savefile's acrosss versions ? 
Probably not. Due to the constant internal changes sin desmume, it is unlikely that a savefile created with one version will work with another version of desmume 
Why can't I find a mac binary? 
We have an 0.9.2 mac binary which might not be linked to from the downloads page yet. Go to https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=164579&package_id=186413 
Why does my mac binary say something about being unsupported? 
There is no universal mac binary. Only i386 is supported. I blame the big endians. If you don't like this, better volunteer yourself to fix endian issues in the code (every day, I see something new that makes me say 'hmmmm that doesnt look endian safe') 
Where can I report bugs? 
In the official bug tracker; you may also request features around the same location, too, but in the other trackers. 
Can I attach files to bug reports I did not create myself ? 
SourceForge likes for folks to only respond on items they submit. If you see a ticket that represents something you are encountering, SourceForge doesn't necessarily want you commenting on that. The reasoning for this given by SourceForge is that they feel it is best to open your own ticket, which helps appreciate the extent of issues in many cases. The authors of desmume may or may not agree with this point of view from SourceForge. 
How do I get the latest svn code and build desmume myself? 
Please check out the instructions related to your platform, over at Installing DeSmuME from source 
Whats 'svn' ? 
svn is a developers tool. It's used to let multiple developers work on the same codebase without conflicts. If youre an end-user, don't worry about it. And if you're a developer, see the question on how to get the latest svn code and build desmume yourself. See wikipedia for more info 

What compilers are supported for building desmume from source ? 
At the moment, for Windows Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 and 2008 are the only supported compilers. Dev-c++ is not supported. Why won't you just download visual c++ express? 
For Linux, any recent version of GCC and toolchain should work. 
Im a developer, and would like to contribute to the codebase. What can I do ? 
To start you off in the right direction, the best thing you can do is join the developer team on IRC and discuss your intentions with the developers. 

Im not a developer, but would like to help out anyway. What can I do ? 
The most helpful thing you can do is use it, learn its ins and outs, and learn how to compile svn builds. Then monitor it for regressions and report bugs. You can patrol the bug tracker for bugs which could use elucidation or which, based on your awareness of how the emulator is changing, might be fixed without us having specifically addressed the bug. Basically, be a super user. And hang out on irc. Also, adding to or perfecting the documentation in the wiki is usefull. You could also watch for and answer questions placed on the desmume forum. 

It is hard to zoom in on a widescreen display due to the weird aspect ratio of the DS. 
In fact it is hard to zoom in on a 4:3 screen, too. Proposals involve tearing apart windows and floating them side by side or separately or something. This may happen one day, in the form of side by side windows. 

Why doesn't my openGL 3d work in linux? 
Blame nvidia and ati for putting out shoddy drivers. Then switch to software rasterizer. 

Why doesn't my openGL 3d work in windows? 
You are probably using an ATI video card. ATI driver support of OpenGL is known to be poor. Get an nvidia. Do not argue with that, we are professional programmers and know what we're talking about. Or, switch to software rasterizer 

Why doesn't a menu option or tool exist in my linux or mac build? 
Because making portable tools and platform harnesses are not our cup of tea and so a developer puts a feature into whichever ports he cares about. This policy is never going to change, although some features might migrate to other platforms over time. Better check the manual. 

Why does music sound bad sometimes? 
Most DS music is sequenced music, loaded from the cart to the ARM7 entirely when the level loads. This works fine. Your music that doesn't work is probably streaming music, which loads from the cart on the fly and goes straight to the speakers. This is much harder to emulate as it requires correct timing, which is not one of desmume's strengths right now. This may not be fixed for a while. 

Why doesn't my game boot or progress into the main game engine? 
Desmume is not perfect yet. Some games may fail due to wifi emulation. Apparently if you search the web correctly you can find ways to patch games to work better on emulators. 

What hardware features are emulated? 
All known 2d graphics features are correct. Mosaics work but are imperfect. There may be small issues with colors as the correct color bit depths are not used at all points in the pipeline. 
All 3d features are emulated, except for: tests, wireframes, edge marking, fog, and antialising. The opengl engine is near its limit and renders some things incorrectly. Eventually the software rasterizer (will support more features and be far more precise in the basic features. Both engines have trouble with some shadows, but software rasterizer is better. Software rasterizer has some noticeable texturing issues right now, especially in 2d games. Software rasterizer supports more correct lighting interpolation than opengl ever will (e.g. glitches at the edge of the screen while scrolling.) In software rasterizer, there are issues similar to 2d with incorrect bit depth being used in the pipeline. There are inaccurate edge conditions in each renderer; in opengl, textures tend to get overdrawn; in software rasterizer, edges of textures tend to be jittery. 
One last thing -- if buttons and labels and menus rendering on the 3d screen are obscured (for example, a button but no label is on it) then you may need to use the software rasterizer. 

All sound features are emulated. The microphone support is new and the manual should be consulted, where you will find out, among other things, that it is only supported in windows right now. 
Wifi is not supported. It is currently under slow and incomplete development. Therefore, you may find this option missing, or simply 'greyed-out' for now. Also, since WIFI support does not work yet, don't ask any questions about it's functioning because it still is unfinished and does not work yet. 
We are unaware of any outstanding issues in the core system hardware (cpu, dma, mmu) but there are certainly still some. The instruction and memory timings are quite incorrect; however, this seems not to hurt most softwares. 
DLDI does anybody know if this still works? 
Dynamically Linked Driver Interface, commonly known as DLDI, is a driver framework that allows NDS and GBA homebrew to easily read and write to any number of different devices, just by substituting a driver file. 
RTC (real-time clock) works; This is what makes the time in your games stay at 00:00:00, and what makes your random number values always come up the same. 
Does the GDB stub still work? 
This has not been built into the public releases, nor has the feature been tested in a while. If you want to be a test user, please hop on IRC and coordinate with us. 

Where/what is IRC? 
IRC is an on-line communication system. 

data you need: 

server: irc.freenode.net 
port: 6667 
channel: #desmume 
what to use: 

mIRC - windows 
ChatZilla - FireFox add-on 
xchat - X 
plenty other, see wikipedia 
Where is the manual? 
A manual for desmume is over at http://wiki.desmume.org/index.php?title=Manual. It may not have the information that other entries in this FAQ promised that it would. 

How do I enter 'cheat codes' in desmume ? 
It is impossible yet to use "commercial" codes, such as Action Replay and Codebreaker, so what you'll have to do is manually search for, and alter the memory positions to your advantage. There's an excellent article in the wiki on Using Cheats in DeSmuMe 

Why is the emulator slow? 
Because nobody pays us to work on it full time and it runs fast enough for us to be happy. Well, almost. The cheapest way to get 60fps is to buy the cart. Buying a newer, faster computer is somewhat more expensive, and it has other side benefits. Also, if you are in Windows, make sure you have tried the SSE build which helps a little bit. Additionally, if you are using someone else's interim build it might not be fully optimized since we make our Windows releases using some profiler-guided optimization which helps by several FPS. You could try turning off the sound. And one last thing: try a new video card. But only as long as it is an nvidia. Also, a faster CPU is more helpfull than a bleeding edge graphics card. desmume is more CPU intensive than it is GPU intensive. It just needs a graphics card that is glitch-free, and currently the nvidia cards have a better track record. 

What are the minimum hardware requirements for desmume ? 
From a purely technical viewpoint, there are no minimum requirements. However, for 'real-world' playable speeds, you would need at least the following : 

Windows OS: Windows XP or Vista 
Linux OS: Any recent Linux distribution with a 2.6 kernel. 
2 GHz Processor 
512 MB Available System Memory 
Available Hard Drive Space: A few MB for desmume, and several GB for the nds files. 
128 MB 3D Video Card (Nvidia GeForce 6800 or better), ATI cards are not recommended. 
Optional: Sound Card, if you want sound support 
Optional: Microphone, if you wish to make use the Windows Microphone feature 
What are the recommended hardware requirements for desmume ? 
From a purely technical viewpoint, there are no recommended requirements. However, for 'real-world' playable speeds, the following gives you good performance: 

Windows OS: Windows XP or Vista 
Linux OS: Any recent Linux distribution with a 2.6 kernel. 
3 GHz Processor 
1 GB Available System Memory 
Available Hard Drive Space: A few MB for desmume, and lots of GB's for the nds files. 
512 MB 3D Video Card (Nvidia GeForce), ATI cards are not recommended. 
Sound Card.

Does desmume support wifi ? 
Wifi is not supported. It is currently under slow and incomplete development. Therefore, you may find this option missing, or simply 'greyed-out' for now. Also, since WIFI support does not work yet, don't ask any questions about it's functioning because it still is unfinished and does not work yet. Furthermore, current development activities focus mainly on the Windows build. 

Why do I get an assert in wifi.cpp which keeps me from playing a game? 
This was a glitch in 0.9.2 release. The download package has been replaced. Download it again and check the changelog to see if you have the fixed version. 

OK, then why does it make my firewall alert since 0.9.2 ? 
Your firewall is stupid, or winsock is stupid, (I am not sure which yet) for alerting just when winsock gets initialized. The emulator hasnt actually tried to connect to the internet yet. How could it? There isn't any wifi. All we are doing is some network initialization code. For those of you who are still not satisfied, then I will admit that there is actually some wifi code--but it doesnt actually do anything yet! Except alert your firewall. Sorry. Also, maybe that is actually a good, unobtrusive time for firewalls to alert. But I am not sorry for calling them stupid. They are hyperactive crybabies. 

Does desmume support the microphone ? 
Yes, but only on the Windows port. You do have to have an actual microphone attached to your PC, though. And perhaps somewhat confusing, the Linux ports do report 'Microphone successfully initialized' on startup of the emulator - but currently this is just a piece of stub (dummy) code used only to correctly start the emulator. 

Where can I find technical details on the Nintendo DS and GBA ?

Does the 'GBA slot' option let me play GBA games ? 
No. A 'real' Nintendo DS can use the gba slot to play gba games, but desmume does not emulate this. But a 'real' Nintnedo DS can also use the gba slot to access gba roms and sram so that ds games can import savefiles, and that part is emulated by desmume. If you are looking for a Game Boy Advance (GBA) emulator, perhaps you can try mednafen or visualboy advance. 

What is DLDI ? 
let me give you an overview on DLDI. You should know that there are many various flash cartridges for DS. They use different file allocation systems, different storages, etc. They are used for launching homebrew. So to make one proram run on all cards. You’d have to write support for each and every card so that it worked for everyone. But none needs support for other cards than their And then genial solution was found. There was an universal IO unit made that’s just interface to IO operations. If you don't have a DS, why do you bother with desmume ? You surely don't have bought any game to run on it. And compiled program does not know how to handle file system etc. And then user can append IO routines for his own card. “DLDI patch”. So, now when I have an M3 cart. I download rom, patch it with m3 DLDI patch. And it works on my cart. Say you had Supercard instead. You’d have to download very same rom and apply Supercart DLDI patch to it. DLDI patch is the same for all roms. So it’s easy for both developper and end user. 

I get the error: Data could not be accessed. Turn off the power and reinsert the DS card. 
The automatic savetype detection probably failed to detect the correct savetype, and you have to set it manually to the correct type. If you are lucky, information about your game (and the corresponding savetype) can be found on a website such as http://www.advanscene.com/. And if you're not as lucky, you'll just have to try them all out until you find the correct type. 

How can I post a screenshot file on the desmume forum ? 
You can create a screenshot, and then upload it to a free external service provider like ImageShack (http://imageshack.us/), and then put the provided links to the page in the message you post on the forum. 

How can I post a savefile or avi capture on the desmume forum ? 
After you created it, yo can upload it to a free external service provider like MediaFire (http://www.mediafire.com/), and then put the provided links to the page in the message you post on the forum. 

How can I post a large log or other text file on the desmume IRC chat room ? 
Make use of the external service provider 'pastebin' (http://pastebin.com/), and post the url to it on the IRC channel. 

My display is incorrect or corrupted 
Try switching the 3D Renderer from opengl or SoftRasterizer, or vice versa, to see if that resolves the bug. In windows, the default hotkey to do this quickly is numpad minus. 

What are the origins of DeSmuME ? 
DeSmuME is a freeware emulator for the Nintendo DS created by YopYop156. 

Due to change in French laws regarding emulation YopYop has decided to stop development of DeSmuME Nintendo DS emulator but that doesn't mean that DeSmuME is obsolete - programmers in this project have picked up where Yopyop left off. The original website was http://yopyop156.ifrance.com/. 

Yopyop said: 

It’s release under GPL. I have just removed the new 3D engine because it’s too much bugged. Hopefully it will be helpful for some of you. 

The latest statement heard from yopyop was : 

DeSmuMe project is over. 
You may don’t know but there are a new law in France that could put me in big trouble. 
With DeSmuMe, I have closed the doors of game company but I can not offer to pay for it. 
The worst thing is that I have found the bad coded instructions. 
For those how have download the sources you have to look in sbc, rsbc instructions the Carry flag updating is wrong. 
Sorry for the home brew programmers. 
For the illegality the demonstration seemed to me convincing thus without proof clarify I prefer to stick to this decision. 
It is also the fact that few people seem interested by the project. Put besides some people who sent demonstrations to me which did not go, I received only malls to wonder to make function such or such plays or to ask me why moved is in French . 
Thus I will not do something of useless and illegal. 
For the site it would not obstruct me if there were not the bond on the left which does nothing but add to confusion on the goal of the project. 
And for the sources it is the same problem as for the project. 
good week end 
yopyop 
edit the law relates to the royalties and the rights close, not?
